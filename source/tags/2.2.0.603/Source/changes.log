	- [ENH] ***MINOR POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE*** Changed method signature for SqlParameterFilterCollection in DAL and Service methods to IParamterFilterCollection (You can now just pass in a ParameterBuilder type, and the engine will call GetParameters() automatically).  No consumption of the implementation should break unless your bound to the SqlParameterFilterCollection by a 3rd party.
	- [ENH] ***MINOR POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE*** Made unit tests atomic for any data calls.  to do so, i had to update the CreateMock() and UpdateMock() to signatures of CreateMock(TransactionManager tm) UpdateMock(TransactionManager tm, MyEntity mock), so you will have to update the two methods in your class user files.
	- [ENH] ***MINOR POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE*** Removed junction tables from doing any data access other than inserts.  It too dificult to determine and validate fk constraint checks.  So if you want them in your tests, then just add them in your user code unit test file.

	- [ENH] Modified ParameterizedSqlFilterBuilder to not require the call of GetParameters() to create the filter.  Now you can just pass the builder to the Find method and it will automatically create the filter. (contrib ToddMoon)

	- [FIX] Corrected Unit Test FK, and disabled INSERT/UPPDATE/DELETE tests for Junction Tables.
