    <h1>Welcome to the .netTiers Petshop Administration Area</h1>
    <p>
        This is a preview of an upcoming full featured web admin that we will be providing as generated code as well.  
        98% everything in this admin area is already generated, so there's only a few tweaks left to finish before it goes public.
        Please use this area to examine how to use the EntityDataSource and it's relationship links, to create
        advanced UI screens. Bobby Diaz, Mike Shatny, and John Teague have done an excellent job in coordinating ideas to making Asp.net UI great and best of all, Easy!
