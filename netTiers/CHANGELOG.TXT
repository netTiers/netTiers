10/14/2005 
        - fixed when larger tables cause the C# compiler to complain about lines being too long.
          Line cannot exceed 2046 characters.  Lines are now wrapped at around 132 columns. This 
          only affected the construstors that passed in all the columns in a table,
          EntityBase.cst and EntityCollectionBase.cst.
        - fixed IEntity.cst when a column exists in all tables, the accessor did not call 
          GetPropertyName on the column name.

10/14/2005
        - Fix the property's case problem in DeepLoad, one to one relationship.

10/12/2005
        - Add the missing BindableAttribute on the entities generated from views.
        - Fix some comments in CommonSqlCode.cs

10/11/2005

10/08/2005
        - Fix GetByFK and deep load for when foriegn keys have more than one column.
        - Changed loading of user defined data types to call sp_MShelptype instead of query system tables.  Attempt to load
          user defined data types only happens if the DatabaseSchema.Provider.Name is "SqlSchemaProvider".  Placeholder for
          other providers is provided (no pun in intended).


10/07/2005
	- SqlEntityProviderBase.cst : 
		throw new DataException("Cannot find the unique instance of the class."); // ** thrown when get by unique index -- function should return null object??
		throw new DataException("The record has been already deleted."); // ** thrown when a delete affected no rows -- function should just return false instead
	- TransactionManager.cst : DataException replaced by InvalidOperationException when appropriate.

10/05/2005
	- nettiersconfigdata.config.cst : Use strored procedure was not correctly placed
	- EntityCollectionBase.cst : Fix the IBindingList support
	


10/04/2005 
        - Fixed multi-line C# XML comments
        - Added support for user-defined data types. User defined data types are dynamically loaded from the source database.

9/29/2005
	- fix the IBindingList implementation

9/26/2205
	-EntityRepositoryTest.cst : Unit tests were broken when the tables that are part of a key were not include.

9/23/2005 - John Roland
	- EntityProviderBase.cst, SqlEntityProvider.cst: move TransactionManager overload to the base class. now providers have to indicate if they support transaction or not.
	- StoredProceduresXml.cst : Fixing the Find issue with text and binary column.

9/23/2005 - Phil bolduc
	NetTiers.cst - added passing IncludeGetListByFK to EntityRepositoryTest.cst
	BusinessLogicLayer\Views\EntityView.cst - Changed <summary> tag to read view instead of table
	BusinessLogicLayer\Views\EntityViewBase.cst - Added same edits as EntityBase.cst for null columns (Property,IsNull,Copy,ToString,Equals)
	BusinessLogicLayer\EntityBase.cst - Get propery value no longer throws exception if null. ToString() uses String.Empty if column is null instead of 		"null"
	UnitTests\EntityRepositoryTest.cst - Added IncludeGetListByFK propery. Include Deep Load tests only if IncludeGetListByFK = true.  EntityBase.cst only renders DeepLoad if IncludeGetListByFK = true, Fixed CreateMockInstance(), UpdateMockInstance() for when 2+ column FK


9/23/2005 - john
	- move transactions overload in base provider
	- added FileNameEditor selector for the alias files
	
9/22/2005 - Tony Selke / John Roland
	- added new features in collection base: IListSource, ITypedList, IDisposable, IComponent implementation


9/21/2005
	- Fixed forum bug: http://forum.codesmithtools.com/default.aspx?f=19&p=1&m=7927#m7935
		(Unclean name on isNull) (Dave Sanders)
	- Fixed forum bug: http://forum.codesmithtools.com/default.aspx?f=19&m=7761
		(making custom sprocs convert to null) (Dave Sanders)

9/18/2005
	- CommonSql.cs : fix of the many to many problem (Phil Bolduc)
	
9/18/2005 - Fix - [ 1257329 ] Nullable primitive data types handled wrong
	- EntityBase.cst, commonsql.cs, SqlEntityProviderBase.cst
		Nullable value types (int, smallint, etc) are now handled with a
		boolean flag instead of relying on default value of the type. Column
		property getter now throws InvalidOperationException if value is null.
		Column property setter throws ArgumentNullException if attempt to set
		reference type (ie varchar) type columns to null if they are NOT NULL
		in the database.


9/9/2005
	- StoredProceduresXml.cst: find method was not working with tables that have text or image column(s)

9/2/2005
	- Changed StoredProceduresXml.cst to not generate GRANT statement if the GrantUser property is not filled



9/1/2005
	- Added BusinessLogicLayerNameSpace variable

8/26/2005
	- Changed the sql view provider so that they work like the table provider
	- Achived the CLS compliancy

8/24/2005 - Changed SQL behavior to always generate .SQL file (Dave Sanders)
	Before this change, the user had to select "ExecuteSql" to request the SQL be generated.
	Now its generated every time.

8/24/2005 - Added "Alias" functionality
	The Alias is an optional file that allows the user to map table names to new class name aliases.
	The file is a simple text file with each line being an alias:
	
	MyTableName:MyClassName
	
	All references to that table will be replaced with the alias name.  This is useful for systems
	that have unruly database names that make the code "ugly" or cause confusion or difficulty.
	The underlying stored procedures are not affected however, maintaining database readability.
